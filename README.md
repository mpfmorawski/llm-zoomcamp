# llm-zoomcamp

Welcome to my LLM Zoomcamp Repo!

This repository contains my solutions to the homework assignments and other materials developed by me and related to the [LLM Zoomcamp course](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp/tree/main). I'm excited to share my learning journey with you, and I hope you find the resources here helpful. Feel free to explore, ask questions, and learn alongside me!
